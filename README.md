#     gnome-display-switcher-hdmi for Wayland



**Script Name:** `hdmi-swicth-python.py`

**Description:** A Python script to manage and switch between different display configurations on a GNOME-based Linux system. It allows users to easily toggle between internal display, external monitor, mirrored displays, or extended desktop mode. The script uses D-Bus to interact with the GNOME Mutter display configuration interface, providing a simple command-line tool for managing multi-monitor setups.

Features:

    Switch to internal display only.

    Switch to external monitor only.

    Enable mirroring across all connected displays.

    Set up an extended desktop (side-by-side mode) for multiple monitors.

Usage: Run the script with a command-line argument (internal, external, mirror, or join) to apply the desired display configuration.
